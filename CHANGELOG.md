## Product Lifecycle

This product is supported by the Application Development UX Standards Working Group at the University of Illinois on a best-effort basis.

As of the last update to this README, possible End-of-Life and End-of-Support dates of this product are June 2029.
This date should roll forward as future browser releases become available.

Web browsers provide very short official support windows (if any).
But an examintation of the history of the shared EMCA Script Standard (for JavaScript) suggests minor breaking changes roughly every five years, from each annual June update.

End-of-Life was decided based on these dependencies:

- Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR) 115 (Support Ends March 2025 - https://whattrainisitnow.com/release/?version=esr)
- Firefox ESR 128 (Support Ends Sep 2025)
- Firefox ESR 140 (Support Ends June 2026)
- Google Chrome (Support Ends 8 weeks after release - https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/process/release_cycle.md)
- Microsoft Edge (Support Ends 16 weeks after release- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-support-lifecycle)
- ECMAScript - The shared cross-browser JavaScript implementation standard. The ECMAScript standard is updated annually in June. [The ISO ECMA Script Specificationhas a 5 year lifecycle](https://www.iso.org/standard/73002.html). [ECMA Script 2024 introduces minor breaking changes for JavaScript code written targeting the ECMAScript 2019 Standard and earlier versions.](https://262.ecma-international.org/15.0/#sec-additions-and-changes-that-introduce-incompatibilities-with-prior-editions). Searching for more than minor breaking changes, we find that [ECMAScript 2009 included substantial breaking changes from previous versions.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript_version_history). An conservative esimtate of earliest likely breaking changes for this effort, due to changes in the ECMAScript Standard, is June 2029.
