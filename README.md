# App-Illinois Design Resources

Resources for web application design from the Application Development UX Standards Workgroup.

The Application Development UX Standards workgroup expands on the work of the WIGG group to include additional design standards and best practices for transactional business web applications developed internally to the University of Illinois.

The objectives are intended to create consistency across products, encourage reuse of code, and improve development efficiency.

Areas of focus include user experience, design, authentication, navigation, and accessibility.
